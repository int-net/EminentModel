# EMINENT Documentation

## Introduction

This is the manual for anyone wishing to perform a EMINENT maturity assessment of an interoperability maturity model. 

## Overview

The purpose of the EMIMENT maturity assessment is to help interoperability communities to become more robust and sustainable by measuring the change of their organizational maturity over time. The insight this provides can help these communities make strategic decisions in how to further develop themselves.

While the most insight can be gained by performing multiple EMINENT studies over time, even a single EMINENT study can provide insight to interoperability community leaders.
